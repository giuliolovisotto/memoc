	Abstract = {This paper proposes a new application of particle swarm optimization for traveling salesman problem. We have developed some special methods for solving TSP using PSO. We have also proposed the concept of swap operator and swap sequence, and redefined some operators on the basis of them, in this way the paper has designed a special PSO. The experiments show that it can achieve good results.},
